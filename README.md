Addon for the plugin AbilitySlots, for Avatar bending in Minecraft.
It is designed to be a reimplementation of [ProjectKorra](https://github.com/ProjectKorra/ProjectKorra).
The addon may contain code similar or identical to the code from the
[ProjectKorra](https://github.com/ProjectKorra/ProjectKorra),
[atlacore](https://github.com/plushmonkey/atlacore),
[Bending](https://github.com/PrimordialMoros/Bending)
projects. For which thanks to their developers.
If you are a developer of one of these projects and something does not suit you, do not be offended.
Write to me and we will definitely find a solution.
I hope for your understanding given that this is a human product and not a commercial one.
